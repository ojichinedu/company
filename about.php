            <p style="text-indent:5%;"><b> In 2014, Thomas Gunther with the aid of his friend and associate Moises Vanderberg, began managing discretionary assets with a fundamental belief in capitalism and free capital markets. With Thomas's vision and Moises's experience, they were able to achieve a lot, and went from handling portfolios of friends and family to building a closed network pool of investors and high end individuals. In less than a decade, they've handled assets worth over $2billion in management and is on course to becoming a financial global brand. Thomas and Moises have always been a dynamic duo ever so interested in emerging technology, and on coming across the blockchain and cryptocurrency, fell in love with it's message of decentralization and transparency. Over the evolution in the blockchain technology where sectors like Defi and Gamefi developed, it was obvious that the power of investments should also be decentralized and put directly in the hands of investors and portfolio managers. In the quest to make this vision turn into a reality, Alex Griffith a backend developer and blockchain programmer,was brought into the team and after years of research and lobbying, Definance Protocol was created and is what has been developed and backs Definance.Throughout our history, we have continuously developed ways to look at capital markets differently and this has been due to the great contribution of Thomas and Moises. Definance makes use of the Price to Sales Ratio and detailed its relevance as a tool for investment analysis. This tool was used to help manage small-cap value portfolios for our institutional investors. Thomas and Moises evolved to Definance Financial Group and have since contributed to the recognition of distinct investment styles. We used these advancements as the foundation for a new series of broad mandate strategies, including Global Total Return, US Total Return, and Foreign Equity. Definance Financial Group began offering separate portfolio Group directly to high net worth individuals under our Private Client Group. 
The Definance protocol has 13 nodes across 8 countries and has served over 37,000 clients globally. In addition, we have dedicated significant resources to the emerging field of behavioral finance to better understand not just the tools of finance, but also how investors use these tools. Our research has led us to develop practical applications of behavioral finance in our portfolio management process.

These non-conventional investments are classified as tangible (real estate, precious metals, commodities, etc.) and intangible (private equity, hedge funds, cryptocurrency, etc.).
